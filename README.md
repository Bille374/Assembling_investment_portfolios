## Crypto_Clustering-Kmeans-PCA
 
 In this Module ML algo is combination between Python and unsupervised learing.
 One CVS file provides crypto dataset
 
 The resolve this challenge we need to follow these steps:
 
 Import the Data,Prepare the Data, find the best Kmeans with original Data, minimize Data by using Principal component Analysis then the best   K using PCA Data Clusters.
 at the end Visualize and compare the results
 
 # Import The Data
